## Minimum Operations
### Overview

This Python script calculates the minimum number of operations needed to obtain a specific number of 'H' characters in a text file, using the 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations. The script provides a simple solution to the problem by recursively applying the operations.

### Functionality

The core functionality is provided by the `minOperation` function in the `min_operations.py` script. It recursively calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve the specified count of 'H' characters.
